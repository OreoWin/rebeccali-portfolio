Welcome! I'm Rebecca Li, currently pursuing an M.S. in Applied Statistics and Data Science at **UCLA**. Prior to UCLA, I earned dual B.A. degrees in Statistics and Economics from **UC Davis**.

I’m passionate about uncovering the stories behind data — finding the patterns that explain human behavior and the insights that drive better decisions. My interest in marketing analytics began during my internship at Li Auto, where I analyzed intelligent driving and referral data to understand user behavior. That experience sparked a deeper curiosity about how data can guide real-world business strategy.

Now, I’m conducting market research and marketing analysis for [AutoUnify](https://autounify.com){target="_blank"} where I explore how data integration can empower the automotive industry.

**Graduating June 2026 \| Actively seeking full-time opportunities**
