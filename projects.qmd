### XGBoost vs. SVM — Classification and Decision Boundaries
*Dec 2024*

**Summary**

Compared the performance and decision boundaries of two popular machine learning algorithms — XGBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) — on a simulated binary classification dataset. The goal was to visualize how each model learns nonlinear boundaries and evaluate their relative performance on synthetic data.

**Process**

- Generate 5,000 two-feature points with binary labels from a distance-to-origin rule.

- Split data into train/test (80/20).

- Train XGBoostClassifier and SVC with default hyperparameters.

- Evaluate train vs. test accuracy.

- Visualize decision boundaries with Matplotlib.

**Outcome**

- XGBoost: Train 99.95%, Test 98.7%.

- SVM: Train 99.2%, Test 99.0%.

- Both high accuracy; SVM generalizes slightly better, while XGBoost is more adaptive with mild overfit risk.

### California Wildfire Damage Analysis

**Summary**

Investigated patterns and relationships among wildfire damage indicators across California using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The goal was to uncover latent dimensions driving wildfire severity and evaluate the interdependence between physical and economic loss variables.

**Process**

- Collected and cleaned wildfire damage data (acres burned, homes/businesses destroyed, vehicles damaged, injuries, fatalities, financial loss).

- Replaced missing numeric values with mean imputation; standardized continuous variables.

- Performed PCA to reduce dimensionality and visualize factor contributions to total variance.

- Conducted Factor Analysis (MLE + Varimax) to identify constructs explaining correlated damage metrics.

- Evaluated factor adequacy via KMO (= 0.5) and Bartlett’s test (p = 0.69).

**Outcome**

- First two principal components explained ~37% of total variance, with Area Burned and Financial Loss dominant.

- Factor Analysis revealed two interpretable factors: (1) property/economic damage and (2) physical impact/casualties.

- Findings suggest financial losses correlate strongly with infrastructure destruction, while injuries/fatalities form a distinct severity dimension.

### Portfolio Construction and Risk Analysis
*Feb 2025*

**Summary**

Focused on portfolio optimization and risk evaluation using real-world stock data from the technology and financial sectors. The goal was to construct and analyze multiple portfolio types—including Minimum Variance, Tangency, and Target Return portfolios—across different time periods, and to assess their performance using modern portfolio theory and CAPM.

**Process**

- Collected daily/monthly prices (2020–2023) and computed log-returns.

- Applied Markowitz Mean–Variance Optimization in R under a no-short-selling constraint for 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, and 15% target returns.

- Computed Tangency and Minimum Variance portfolios, using a dynamic risk-free rate from 10-year U.S. Treasury yields.

- Ran CAPM to estimate alpha/beta vs. SPY and QQQ; tested significance to gauge market efficiency.

- Estimated Value-at-Risk (VaR) with a multivariate t-distribution to quantify downside risk.

**Outcome**

- Including financial sector stocks improved diversification and reduced volatility.

- Tangency portfolios achieved the highest Sharpe ratios (better risk-adjusted returns).

- CAPM results showed most alphas were statistically insignificant (consistent with market efficiency).

- VaR indicated Tangency portfolios carry higher potential downside risk yet deliver superior long-term returns.
